# keras-timestopping-callback
TimeStopping callback for Keras. This implementation is compatible with restore_best_weights, it is compatible with the monitor parameter you can find in EarlyStopping, and it is being clear about which stopping callback was triggered when restore_best_weights is set to True. It is based on https://github.com/tensorflow/addons/pull/757/commits/57c19081b1130f5dd02f60c2b3d1b61579632a57.
